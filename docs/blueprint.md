## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#3B82F6) to evoke trust and security. (The company name hints at the idea of safety.)
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F9FF), visibly in the same hue as the primary color, but desaturated to only 20% saturation, providing a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#8B5CF6) to complement the blue and draw attention to calls-to-action. (The vibrant accent complements the primary blue; purple's heightened brightness and saturation provides contrast.)
- Body: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Headlines: 'Playfair', serif.
- Use sharp, modern icons to represent security features and services.
- Clean, single-page layout with clear sections for each feature.
- Subtle fade-in effects when scrolling through sections.
